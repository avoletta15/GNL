<h1 align="center">Get_next_line</h1>

## Description :clipboard:
<p>
This project leads the path to learn about <em>static variables</em> and its use in C, by creating a function that returns a line red from a
file descriptor [fd]. The <em>bonus part</em></em> is not much complex: is a get_next_line function that uses only one static variable and can manage multiple file descriptors at the same time.

External functions used: `read()`, `malloc()` & `free()`.
